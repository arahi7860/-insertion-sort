// Insertion Sort

// Sort through an Array. Start at index 1 (second element) so that it can be 
// compared to index 0 since index 0 is now considered sorted.

// The second index will be run through from RIGHT to LEFT until it finds 
// the correct location.

// Each element should move over by 1 to make room for the new element being sorted.
